Abstract: Carbon taxes are among the economists' most debated policies for tackling climate change. However, they've rarely been applied to the manufacturing sector and studies covering their effects on this field are even scarcer. We, thus, look at how BC manufacturers' carbon intensity was impacted by the 2008's carbon tax through an application of the synthetic control method. We find that the tax was effective in 2006, right after its announcement or 2 years before its implementation, and we estimate it to have caused, over the period from 2006 to 2018, a 40% decrease in the BC manufacturing firms' carbon intensity. We also conclude that this effect is robust and significant through a series of Placebo tests. Additionally, we observe that how much of a country's economy depends on manufacturing and the share of low carbon energy it produces are not predictors of carbon intensity.Â
